- Create PROGRESS.md, BUGS.md & DECISION.md if not already existing. Update the PROGRESS.md file after every turn with a concice checklist of what you've been able to accomplish, while adding bug reports to BUGS.md file. Use the DECISIONS.md file to log every architectural decision you make. Keep these notes short & concentrated.
- Make sure that any new entry you make to the PROGRESS.md DECISIONS.md & BUGS.md files are always first in --> Meaning every new entry should be at the top of the file.
- Please pay attention to the way in which the debug/error/print statements are written and use emojis, please continue to do so but and only use the emojis that have already been used.
