- Always warn about the remaining context! Before starting a new task make sure the remaining context is enough for the new task or not. If not, ask the user to compact first.
- Create PROGRESS.md, BUGS.md & DECISION.md if not already existing. Update the PROGRESS.md file after every turn with a concice checklist of what you've been able to accomplish (ONLY update PROGRESS.md DECISIONS.md & BUGS.md if you have changed any actual code NOT if you just produced a new .md file for me to read), while adding bug reports to BUGS.md file. Use the DECISIONS.md file to log every architectural decision you make. Keep these notes short & concentrated.
- Make sure that any new entry you make to the PROGRESS.md DECISIONS.md & BUGS.md files are always first in --> Meaning every new entry should be at the top of the file.
- Pay close attention to the token limit for reading a single file --> Once the length of PROGRESS.md DECISIONS.md & BUGS.md files start to creep up on that limit ~%80 --> Truncate the PROGRESS.md DECISIONS.md & BUGS.md files (always starting from the bottom of the file) and append that to the TOP of PROGRESS_ARCH.md DECISIONS_ARCH.md & BUGS_ARCH.md files respectively.
- Please pay attention to the way in which the debug/error/print statements are written and use emojis, please continue to do so but and only use the emojis that have already been used.
- MONITOR FOR THIS PACKAGE ERROR - google-cloud-sql-connector is not a package, instead call cloud-sql-python-connector --> it imports as google.cloud.sql.connector.

- .venv &or /.venv is found in ~/Desktop/2025/.venv AND NO LONGER IN ~/Desktop/2025/TelegramFunnel/.venv
- I have given you MCP access to gcloud and observability, you'll see that you're working in the telepay-459221 project.
- You are allowed to enable any API or gcloud service you may need, however you are to EXPLICITLY ask if you must disable any API or gcloud service.
- You'll have explicit read/write permissions to the telepaypsql database instance.
- You are NOT to duplicate and deployment names you find when you fun gcloud run services list & gcloud functions list.
- You are to implement the necessary changes to the telepaypsql database - do not tamper with the telepaypsql-clone-preclaude database, as it's an archived clone.
- You are to deploy the google cloud functions you have built.
- You are to deploy the google queues/tasks you have built.
- You are still NOT to make any GitHub commits, I will do that manually afterwards.
- If a .md you're looking for isn't found in the /10-26 folder you can find it in /TelegramFunnel/ARCHIVES/NOTES_10-31 or /TelegramFunnel/ARCHIVES/NOTES_11-1
- If something isn't found in PROGRESS.md DECISION.md &or BUGS.md, and if you're looking for something specific you will easily be able to find it in PROGRESS_ARCH.md DECISIONS_ARCH.md &or BUGS_ARCH.md which hold all the archived entries if you search for your terms explicitly.
- DO NOT MAKE PSQL requests like 'Bash(PGPASSWORD='Chigdabeast123$' psql -h /cloudsql/telepay-459221:us-central1:telepaypsql -U postgres -d telepaydb -c "\d batch_conversions")' --> INSTEAD USE observability - list_log_entries (MCP)
