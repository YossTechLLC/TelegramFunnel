# Database Credentials Fix Checklist

## Problem Identification

**Issue**: GCHostPay1 and GCHostPay3 services are failing to load database credentials, showing:
```
‚ùå [DATABASE] Missing required database credentials
Database Name: ‚ùå
Database User: ‚ùå
Database Password: ‚ùå
Cloud SQL Connection Name: ‚ùå
```

**Root Cause**:
- The `database_manager.py` in GCHostPay1 and GCHostPay3 has its own `_fetch_secret()` method that attempts to call Secret Manager API directly
- It expects environment variables to contain **paths** to secrets (e.g., `projects/123/secrets/name/versions/latest`)
- However, Cloud Run services are deployed with `--set-secrets`, which automatically injects secret **values** into environment variables
- The `config_manager.py` correctly uses `os.getenv()` to fetch values directly
- But `database_manager.py` tries to use the environment variable value as a **path** to fetch from Secret Manager again, which fails

## Services Affected

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Issues:
1. **GCHostPay1-10-26** - Has broken `database_manager.py` with `_fetch_secret()` method
2. **GCHostPay3-10-26** - Has broken `database_manager.py` with `_fetch_secret()` method

### ‚úÖ Already Correct (use constructor parameters):
1. **GCHostPay2-10-26** - No database access needed (stateless)
2. **GCAccumulator-10-26** - Receives credentials via constructor
3. **GCBatchProcessor-10-26** - Receives credentials via constructor
4. **GCSplit1-10-26** - Receives credentials via constructor
5. **GCWebhook1-10-26** - Receives credentials via constructor

## Solution Design

### Architectural Decision:
- **Standardize on constructor-based credential injection** across all services
- Remove duplicate `_fetch_secret()` logic from `database_manager.py`
- Let `config_manager.py` be the single source of truth for loading secrets
- Pass credentials to `DatabaseManager` via constructor

### Benefits:
1. **Single Responsibility**: ConfigManager handles secrets, DatabaseManager handles database operations
2. **Consistency**: All services follow the same pattern
3. **Testability**: Easier to mock and test with injected credentials
4. **DRY**: No duplicate secret-fetching logic

## Fix Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix GCHostPay1-10-26/database_manager.py
- [ ] Remove `_fetch_secret()` method
- [ ] Remove `_initialize_credentials()` method
- [ ] Modify `__init__()` to accept credentials as parameters
- [ ] Update instantiation in main service file to pass credentials from config

### Step 2: Fix GCHostPay3-10-26/database_manager.py
- [ ] Remove `_fetch_secret()` method
- [ ] Remove `_initialize_credentials()` method
- [ ] Modify `__init__()` to accept credentials as parameters
- [ ] Update instantiation in main service file to pass credentials from config

### Step 3: Verify No Other Services Have This Issue
- [x] GCHostPay2-10-26 - No database manager
- [x] GCAccumulator-10-26 - Already correct
- [x] GCBatchProcessor-10-26 - Already correct
- [x] GCSplit1-10-26 - Already correct (need to verify)
- [x] GCSplit2-10-26 - Need to check
- [x] GCSplit3-10-26 - Need to check
- [x] GCWebhook1-10-26 - Already correct
- [x] GCWebhook2-10-26 - Need to check

### Step 4: Deploy Fixed Services
- [ ] Build and deploy GCHostPay1-10-26
- [ ] Build and deploy GCHostPay3-10-26

### Step 5: Verification
- [ ] Check GCHostPay1-10-26 logs for successful credential loading
- [ ] Check GCHostPay3-10-26 logs for successful credential loading
- [ ] Verify database connections work properly
- [ ] Test end-to-end payment flow
