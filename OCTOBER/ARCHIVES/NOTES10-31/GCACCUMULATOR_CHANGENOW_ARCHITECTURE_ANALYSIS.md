# GCAccumulator ChangeNow API Architecture Analysis

**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Author**: Claude Code
**Status**: Architecture Review & Recommendation

---

## Executive Summary

You've identified a **critical architectural flaw** in the current GCAccumulator implementation. The synchronous ChangeNow API call in the webhook endpoint violates the established Cloud Tasks pattern used throughout the rest of the system and creates a single point of failure.

**Current Problem**: GCAccumulator webhook makes synchronous ChangeNow API calls, blocking the endpoint if ChangeNow is down.

**Recommended Solution**: Move ChangeNow API call to GCSplit2 via Cloud Tasks queue (asynchronous, with infinite retry).

---

## Question 1: Does GCAccumulator webhook now make internal ChangeNow API calls?

### Answer: YES ✅

The current implementation in `acc10-26.py` (lines 123-166) makes a **synchronous** ChangeNow API call directly within the webhook endpoint:

```python
@app.route('/accumulate', methods=['POST'])
def accumulate_payment():
    # ... validation logic ...

    # ⚠️ SYNCHRONOUS API CALL - BLOCKS THE WEBHOOK
    cn_response = changenow_client.get_eth_to_usdt_estimate_with_retry(
        from_amount_usd=str(adjusted_amount_usd),
        from_network="eth",
        to_network="eth"
    )

    if not cn_response:
        abort(500, "ChangeNow conversion failed")

    # ... rest of processing ...
```

**Impact**: The webhook endpoint is **blocked** until ChangeNow responds (potentially 24 hours with infinite retry).

---

## Question 2: Would ChangeNow being down pose a problem?

### Answer: YES - CRITICAL PROBLEM ⚠️

### Current Behavior When ChangeNow is Down:

1. **Webhook Blocking**:
   - The `/accumulate` endpoint enters the infinite retry loop
   - Cloud Run instance hangs waiting for ChangeNow response
   - The instance stays busy and cannot process other requests
   - Cloud Run may spawn multiple instances, each blocking on ChangeNow

2. **Request Timeout**:
   - Cloud Run has a max timeout of 60 minutes (3600 seconds)
   - If ChangeNow doesn't respond within 60 minutes, Cloud Run kills the request
   - The payment is **LOST** because database writes happen AFTER the ChangeNow call

3. **Cascading Failures**:
   - GCWebhook1 calls GCAccumulator and waits for response
   - GCWebhook1 timeout triggers (likely 60-120 seconds)
   - GCWebhook1 retries the same request via Cloud Tasks
   - Multiple parallel requests to GCAccumulator all block on ChangeNow
   - System-wide degradation

4. **Cost Impact**:
   - Multiple Cloud Run instances spawn and remain idle in retry loops
   - Wasted compute resources while waiting for ChangeNow

### Comparison to Other Services:

| Service | ChangeNow Call Location | Architecture |
|---------|------------------------|--------------|
| **GCWebhook1** | No direct call | Uses Cloud Tasks → GCAccumulator |
| **GCAccumulator** | ⚠️ **Direct synchronous call** | **BLOCKING** |
| **GCSplit2** | Direct call in queue handler | Non-blocking (queue-based) |
| **GCHostPay2** | Direct call in queue handler | Non-blocking (queue-based) |

---

## Question 3: Should API calls go through Cloud Tasks queues?

### Answer: YES - THIS IS THE ESTABLISHED PATTERN ✅

### The Cloud Tasks Pattern

The entire system is built on the **asynchronous Cloud Tasks pattern**:

```
┌─────────────┐     Cloud Tasks     ┌─────────────┐     Cloud Tasks     ┌─────────────┐
│ GCWebhook1  │────────────────────>│GCAccumulator│────────────────────>│ GCSplit2    │
│             │  /accumulate task   │             │  /estimate task     │             │
└─────────────┘                     └─────────────┘                     └─────────────┘
      ↓                                    ↓                                    ↓
  Returns 200                         Returns 200                      Calls ChangeNow API
  immediately                         immediately                       (infinite retry)
```

### Why This Pattern Exists:

1. **Fault Isolation**: If ChangeNow is down, only the GCSplit2 queue backs up, not the entire payment pipeline
2. **Automatic Retry**: Cloud Tasks retries failed tasks for up to 24 hours automatically
3. **Non-Blocking**: Each service returns 200 OK immediately after queuing the next task
4. **Observability**: Failed tasks visible in Cloud Tasks console for monitoring
5. **Rate Limiting**: Cloud Tasks controls request rate to prevent overwhelming downstream services

### Current Violation:

GCAccumulator **breaks this pattern** by making synchronous ChangeNow calls, creating a blocking dependency.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Was This Implemented This Way?

Looking at the implementation context:

1. **ETH_TO_USDT_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md** specifies:
   - "GCAccumulator calls ChangeNow API to get real ETH→USDT estimate"
   - Does not specify whether this should be synchronous or via Cloud Tasks

2. **Code Pattern Copied from GCSplit2**:
   - GCSplit2's `changenow_client.py` was used as a reference
   - However, GCSplit2's usage context is different:
     - GCSplit2 is invoked via Cloud Tasks queue
     - GCSplit2 is NOT a webhook that other services depend on
     - GCSplit2 blocking is acceptable because it's already async

3. **Misunderstanding of Accumulator Role**:
   - GCAccumulator was treated as a "processing endpoint" (like GCSplit2)
   - In reality, GCAccumulator is a **synchronous webhook** called by GCWebhook1

---

## Recommended Architecture

### Option 1: Move ChangeNow Call to GCSplit2 (RECOMMENDED ⭐)

**Architecture**:

```
┌─────────────┐                    ┌─────────────┐                    ┌─────────────┐
│ GCWebhook1  │─── Cloud Tasks ───>│GCAccumulator│─── Cloud Tasks ───>│  GCSplit2   │
│             │   /accumulate      │             │   /estimate        │             │
└─────────────┘                    └─────────────┘                    └─────────────┘
      ↓                                    ↓                                  ↓
  Returns 200                         Returns 200                      Calls ChangeNow
  immediately                         immediately                      (infinite retry)
                                           ↓
                                   Stores payment with
                                   accumulated_eth
                                   (not USDT yet)
                                                                              ↓
                                                                      Updates payment with
                                                                      accumulated_usdt
                                                                      eth_to_usdt_rate
```

**Changes Required**:

1. **GCAccumulator `/accumulate` endpoint**:
   - Remove ChangeNow API call
   - Store payment with `accumulated_eth` (the adjusted USD amount in ETH terms)
   - Set `accumulated_usdt = NULL` (to be filled later)
   - Set `eth_to_usdt_rate = NULL` (to be filled later)
   - Set `conversion_tx_hash = NULL` (to be filled later)
   - Queue task to GCSplit2 `/estimate-and-update` endpoint
   - Return 200 OK immediately

2. **GCSplit2 new endpoint `/estimate-and-update`**:
   - Receive payment_id and accumulated_eth
   - Call ChangeNow API with infinite retry
   - Calculate accumulated_usdt and eth_to_usdt_rate
   - Update the payment record in database
   - Check if threshold is met
   - If threshold met, queue task to GCBatchProcessor

3. **GCBatchProcessor** (no changes needed):
   - Already handles USDT-based batch creation correctly

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Non-blocking webhook (returns 200 immediately)
- ✅ ChangeNow failure isolated to GCSplit2 queue
- ✅ Automatic retry via Cloud Tasks (up to 24 hours)
- ✅ Payment data persisted immediately (no data loss)
- ✅ Follows established architectural pattern
- ✅ Observable via Cloud Tasks console

**Trade-offs**:
- ⚠️ Two database writes instead of one (initial + update)
- ⚠️ Slight delay between payment receipt and USDT conversion
- ⚠️ Requires new GCSplit2 endpoint

### Option 2: Use GCSplit2 Existing `/estimate` Endpoint (ALTERNATIVE)

**Architecture**:

```
┌─────────────┐                    ┌─────────────┐                    ┌─────────────┐

      ↓                                    ↓                                  ↓
  Returns 200                         Returns 200                      Calls ChangeNow
  immediately                         immediately                      Returns estimate
                                           ↓                                  ↓
                                   Stores payment with                Queues task to
                                   accumulated_eth                    GCAccumulator
                                   (pending conversion)               /finalize-conversion
                                                                              ↓
                                                                      ┌─────────────┐
                                                                      │GCAccumulator│
                                                                      │ /finalize   │
                                                                      └─────────────┘
                                                                              ↓
                                                                      Updates payment
                                                                      with USDT data
                                                                      Checks threshold
```

**Changes Required**:

1. **GCAccumulator `/accumulate`**:
   - Store payment with `accumulated_eth`, USDT fields NULL
   - Queue task to GCSplit2 `/estimate`
   - Return 200 OK immediately

2. **GCSplit2 `/estimate`** (existing endpoint):
   - Call ChangeNow API
   - Queue task back to GCAccumulator `/finalize-conversion`

3. **GCAccumulator `/finalize-conversion`** (new endpoint):
   - Receive payment_id, accumulated_usdt, eth_to_usdt_rate, conversion_tx_hash
   - Update payment record
   - Check threshold
   - Queue to GCBatchProcessor if threshold met

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Reuses existing GCSplit2 endpoint
- ✅ Non-blocking webhook
- ✅ ChangeNow failure isolated

**Trade-offs**:
- ⚠️ More complex flow (back-and-forth between services)
- ⚠️ Three database operations instead of one
- ⚠️ Harder to debug and trace

---

### Option 3: Keep Current Implementation (NOT RECOMMENDED ❌)

**Current Architecture**:

```
┌─────────────┐                    ┌─────────────┐
│ GCWebhook1  │─── Cloud Tasks ───>│GCAccumulator│
│             │   /accumulate      │  (BLOCKING) │
└─────────────┘                    └─────────────┘
      ↓                                    ↓
  Returns 200                         Calls ChangeNow
  immediately                         (infinite retry)
                                      BLOCKS for up to
                                      60 minutes
```

**Why NOT Recommended**:
- ❌ Violates Cloud Tasks pattern
- ❌ Creates single point of failure
- ❌ Risk of data loss on timeout
- ❌ Cascading failures across system
- ❌ Poor observability (no queue visibility)
- ❌ Wasted compute resources

## Impact on System Reliability

### Current Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Severity |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **ChangeNow API Downtime** | Medium | Critical | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Cloud Run Timeout (60 min)** | High | Critical | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Payment Data Loss** | Medium | Critical | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Cascading GCWebhook1 Failures** | High | High | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Cost Spike (Idle Instances)** | Medium | Medium | 🟡 MEDIUM |

### After Implementing Option 1 (Recommended)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Severity |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **ChangeNow API Downtime** | Medium | Low | 🟢 LOW |
| **Cloud Run Timeout** | Low | Low | 🟢 LOW |
| **Payment Data Loss** | Very Low | Low | 🟢 LOW |
| **Cascading Failures** | Very Low | Low | 🟢 LOW |
| **Cost Spike** | Low | Low | 🟢 LOW |

## Implementation Recommendation

### Immediate Action Plan

**Phase 1: Emergency Fix** (Implement Option 1)

1. **Create new GCSplit2 endpoint**: `/estimate-and-update`
   - Accept: payment_id, adjusted_amount_usd
   - Call ChangeNow API (infinite retry)
   - Update payment record with USDT data
   - Check threshold and queue GCBatchProcessor

2. **Update GCAccumulator `/accumulate`**:
   - Remove ChangeNow API call
   - Store payment with accumulated_eth only
   - Queue task to GCSplit2 `/estimate-and-update`
   - Return 200 OK immediately

3. **Test End-to-End**:
   - Simulate ChangeNow downtime
   - Verify no blocking behavior
   - Verify Cloud Tasks retries
   - Verify threshold checking still works

**Phase 2: Monitoring** (After deployment)

1. Add observability dashboards:
   - GCSplit2 queue depth
   - ChangeNow API latency
   - Conversion completion time
   - Failed conversion rate

2. Add alerting:
   - Alert if GCSplit2 queue depth > 100
   - Alert if ChangeNow API failures > 10% over 5 minutes
   - Alert if conversion completion time > 5 minutes

## Database Schema Implications

### Current Schema (from `PAYOUT_ACCUMULATION_FIELD_EXPLANATIONS.md`)

```sql
-- payment_accumulation table
accumulated_eth          DECIMAL(30,18)  -- Currently NEVER populated
accumulated_usdt         DECIMAL(30,6)   -- Currently populated synchronously
eth_to_usdt_rate        DECIMAL(30,18)  -- Currently populated synchronously
conversion_tx_hash      TEXT            -- Currently populated synchronously
```

### Recommended Schema After Option 1

```sql
-- payment_accumulation table
accumulated_eth          DECIMAL(30,18)  -- Populated immediately by GCAccumulator
accumulated_usdt         DECIMAL(30,6)   -- Populated asynchronously by GCSplit2
eth_to_usdt_rate        DECIMAL(30,18)  -- Populated asynchronously by GCSplit2
conversion_tx_hash      TEXT            -- Populated asynchronously by GCSplit2
conversion_status       VARCHAR(50)     -- NEW: 'pending', 'completed', 'failed'
conversion_attempts     INTEGER         -- NEW: Track retry count
last_conversion_attempt TIMESTAMP       -- NEW: Track last retry time
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear visibility into conversion state
- Can query payments stuck in "pending" state
- Track retry behavior for monitoring
- Audit trail for debugging

## Comparison to Similar Services

### How Other Services Handle External APIs

| Service | External API | Call Location | Pattern |
|---------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| **GCWebhook1** | None | N/A | Webhook receiver → queues tasks |
| **GCWebhook2** | None | N/A | Webhook receiver → queues tasks |
| **GCAccumulator** | ⚠️ ChangeNow | ❌ Synchronous webhook | **VIOLATES PATTERN** |
| **GCSplit1** | None | N/A | Database operation only |
| **GCSplit2** | ChangeNow | ✅ Queue handler | Correct pattern |
| **GCSplit3** | None | N/A | ChangeNow tracking only |
| **GCHostPay1** | Alchemy | ✅ Queue handler | Correct pattern |
| **GCHostPay2** | ChangeNow | ✅ Queue handler | Correct pattern |
| **GCHostPay3** | Blockchain | ✅ Queue handler | Correct pattern |
| **GCBatchProcessor** | None | N/A | Database + queue dispatch |

**Pattern**: All external API calls happen in **queue handlers**, not in **webhook receivers**.

**GCAccumulator** is the ONLY service that violates this pattern.

---

## Conclusion

### Key Findings

1. ✅ **Your assessment is 100% correct**: The current implementation violates the Cloud Tasks pattern
2. ⚠️ **Critical Risk**: ChangeNow downtime will block GCAccumulator and cascade to GCWebhook1
3. ✅ **Solution Exists**: Move ChangeNow call to GCSplit2 via Cloud Tasks queue

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Implement Option 1** (Move ChangeNow to GCSplit2 queue handler)
2. **Add conversion_status field** to track async conversion state
3. **Deploy with monitoring** to verify non-blocking behavior
4. **Test failure scenarios** (simulate ChangeNow downtime)
5. **Update documentation** to reflect new architecture

### Architectural Principle

> **"Webhook receivers should NEVER make blocking external API calls. All external API calls should be delegated to queue handlers with automatic retry."**

This principle is followed everywhere else in the system. GCAccumulator should follow it too.
