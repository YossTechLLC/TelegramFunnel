# Threshold Payout System - Deployment Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY OPERATIONAL - READY FOR TESTING
**Project:** telepay-459221

---

## üéâ Deployment Summary

The threshold payout system has been **fully deployed and verified**. All services are operational and ready for live transaction testing.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Deployed

### 1. Database Schema ‚úÖ
**Status:** All tables and columns exist

- ‚úÖ `main_clients_database` table
  - `payout_strategy` VARCHAR(20) - 'instant' or 'threshold'
  - `payout_threshold_usd` NUMERIC(10, 2) - Minimum threshold amount
  - `payout_threshold_updated_at` TIMESTAMP

- ‚úÖ `payout_accumulation` table
  - Tracks individual payments accumulating toward threshold
  - Locks USD value in USDT to eliminate volatility
  - 18 columns including accumulated_amount_usdt, conversion tracking, payout status

- ‚úÖ `payout_batches` table
  - Tracks batch payouts when threshold is met
  - Includes ChangeNow transaction data, blockchain tx info

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Confirmed: All 3 tables exist
-- Confirmed: 1 channel configured with threshold=$2.00
```

## üîç Test Channel Verification

**Channel Found:**
```
Channel ID: -1003268562225
Title: 10-29 NEW WEBSITE
Strategy: threshold
Threshold: $2.00
Payout: SHIB on ETH
```

This is your test channel that will use the threshold payout system.

---

## üîÑ Complete Payment Flow (Threshold Mode)

### Initial Setup ‚úÖ
1. User registered channel with `payout_strategy='threshold'` and `payout_threshold_usd=2.00`
2. System ready to accumulate payments

### First Payment: $1.35 (EXPECTED BEHAVIOR)

```
User Pays $1.35
    ‚Üì
NOWPayments ‚Üí GCWebhook1
    ‚Üì
GCWebhook1 checks: payout_strategy = 'threshold'
    ‚Üì
Routes to GCAccumulator (instead of GCSplit1)
    ‚Üì
GCAccumulator:
  - Removes 3% TP fee: $1.35 - $0.04 = $1.31
  - Mock converts to USDT: ~$1.31 USDT
  - Writes to payout_accumulation table
  - Checks total: $1.31 < $2.00 threshold
  - Logs: "$0.69 remaining to reach threshold"
    ‚Üì
User gets Telegram invite (sent regardless of strategy)
    ‚Üì
Payment ACCUMULATES (not paid out yet)
```

**Database After First Payment:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM payout_accumulation WHERE client_id = '-1003268562225';
-- Expected: 1 record
-- accumulated_amount_usdt ‚âà 1.31
-- is_paid_out = FALSE
```

### Second Payment: $1.35 (THRESHOLD REACHED)

```
User Pays $1.35 (second time)
    ‚Üì
NOWPayments ‚Üí GCWebhook1 ‚Üí GCAccumulator
    ‚Üì
GCAccumulator:
  - Processes payment: $1.31 USDT
  - Total accumulated: $1.31 + $1.31 = $2.62 USDT
  - Threshold check: $2.62 > $2.00 ‚úÖ
  - Logs: "üéâ Threshold reached! GCBatchProcessor will process on next run"
    ‚Üì
User gets Telegram invite
    ‚Üì
Payment ACCUMULATES (waits for batch processor)
```

**Within 5 Minutes:** Cloud Scheduler triggers GCBatchProcessor

```
GCBatchProcessor (triggered every 5 min)
    ‚Üì
Queries: SELECT client_id, SUM(accumulated_amount_usdt) 
         WHERE is_paid_out = FALSE 
         HAVING SUM(...) >= threshold
    ‚Üì
Finds: client_id = '-1003268562225' with $2.62 USDT
    ‚Üì
Creates batch:
  - batch_id = UUID
  - total_amount_usdt = 2.62
  - status = 'pending'
    ‚Üì
Enqueues to GCSplit1 /batch-payout endpoint
    ‚Üì
Marks accumulation records: is_paid_out = TRUE
    ‚Üì
GCSplit1 ‚Üí GCHostPay flow executes
    ‚Üì
Channel owner receives $2.62 worth of SHIB
```

**Database After Batch:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM payout_accumulation WHERE client_id = '-1003268562225';
-- Both records now have is_paid_out = TRUE
-- payout_batch_id = same UUID

SELECT * FROM payout_batches WHERE client_id = '-1003268562225';
-- 1 batch record with total_amount_usdt = 2.62
```

## üß™ How to Test

### Test 1: First Payment (Accumulation)

1. **Trigger payment** via Telegram bot ($1.35)
2. **Expected outcome:**
   - ‚úÖ Telegram invite sent
   - ‚úÖ Payment accumulates (not paid out)
   - ‚úÖ Database shows 1 record in `payout_accumulation` with ~$1.31 USDT

3. **Verification commands:**
```sql
-- Check accumulation
SELECT * FROM payout_accumulation 
WHERE client_id = '-1003268562225' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Should show:
-- accumulated_amount_usdt ‚âà 1.31
-- is_paid_out = FALSE
-- payout_batch_id = NULL
```

4. **Log verification:**
```bash
# Check GCWebhook1 logs (routing decision)
gcloud logging read "resource.labels.service_name=gcwebhook1-10-26 AND textPayload:threshold" --limit=20

# Expected: "üéØ Threshold payout mode - $2.00 threshold"
# Expected: "Routing to GCAccumulator"

# Check GCAccumulator logs
gcloud logging read "resource.labels.service_name=gcaccumulator-10-26" --limit=20

# Expected: "üí∞ Payment Amount: $1.35"
# Expected: "‚úÖ Adjusted amount: $1.31"
# Expected: "‚è≥ $0.69 remaining to reach threshold"
```

### Test 2: Second Payment (Threshold Trigger)

1. **Trigger second payment** via Telegram bot ($1.35)
2. **Expected outcome:**
   - ‚úÖ Telegram invite sent
   - ‚úÖ Payment accumulates
   - ‚úÖ Total now $2.62 (exceeds $2.00 threshold)
   - ‚úÖ Within 5 minutes, batch processor creates payout
   - ‚úÖ Channel owner receives SHIB

3. **Verification commands:**
```sql
-- Check accumulation (before batch)
SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(accumulated_amount_usdt), is_paid_out
FROM payout_accumulation 
WHERE client_id = '-1003268562225'
GROUP BY is_paid_out;

-- Should show:
-- 2 records with is_paid_out = FALSE
-- Total ‚âà $2.62

-- Wait 5 minutes, then check batch
SELECT * FROM payout_batches 
WHERE client_id = '-1003268562225';

-- Should show batch with total_amount_usdt ‚âà 2.62

-- Check accumulation (after batch)
SELECT * FROM payout_accumulation 
WHERE client_id = '-1003268562225';

-- Both records should now have is_paid_out = TRUE
```

4. **Log verification:**
```bash
# Check GCAccumulator logs
gcloud logging read "resource.labels.service_name=gcaccumulator-10-26" --limit=20

# Expected: "üéâ Threshold reached! GCBatchProcessor will process on next run"

# Check GCBatchProcessor logs (runs every 5 min)
gcloud logging read "resource.labels.service_name=gcbatchprocessor-10-26 AND textPayload:threshold" --limit=20

# Expected: "üìä Found 1 client(s) ready for payout"
# Expected: "‚úÖ Batch created for client -1003268562225"
```

## üìä Monitoring Commands

### Real-Time Service Logs
```bash
# GCWebhook1 (routing decisions)
gcloud logging tail "resource.labels.service_name=gcwebhook1-10-26"

# GCAccumulator (payment accumulation)
gcloud logging tail "resource.labels.service_name=gcaccumulator-10-26"

# GCBatchProcessor (batch processing every 5 min)
gcloud logging tail "resource.labels.service_name=gcbatchprocessor-10-26"
```

### Database Queries
```bash
# Connect to database
gcloud sql connect telepaypsql --user=postgres --database=telepaypsql

# Check accumulation status
SELECT 
    client_id,
    COUNT(*) as payment_count,
    SUM(accumulated_amount_usdt) as total_usdt,
    MIN(is_paid_out) as all_paid_out
FROM payout_accumulation
GROUP BY client_id;

# Check batch history
SELECT * FROM payout_batches ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

## üîê Architecture Highlights

### Volatility Elimination ‚úÖ
- Payments immediately converted to USDT
- USD value locked at conversion time
- No market risk during accumulation period

### Resilience ‚úÖ
- Infinite retry on all Cloud Tasks queues (24h max)
- Mock ETH‚ÜíUSDT conversion for Phase 1 (production ready for ChangeNow)
- Fallback to instant payout if accumulator unavailable

### Scalability ‚úÖ
- Cloud Scheduler handles batch processing automatically
- Multiple clients can accumulate simultaneously
- Each client processed independently (one failure doesn't affect others)

---

## üö® Known Limitations

1. **Mock Conversion:** GCAccumulator uses 1:1 mock rate for ETH‚ÜíUSDT
   - Production: Will integrate with GCSplit2 for real ChangeNow conversion
   - Impact: Testing only (locks USD value correctly, just not using real rate)

2. **Batch Interval:** 5-minute Cloud Scheduler interval
   - Payouts may take up to 5 minutes after threshold reached
   - Can be adjusted to 1 minute if needed

3. **No UI:** Threshold management only via database
   - Future: Add threshold configuration to www.paygateprime.com dashboard

---

## ‚úÖ System Status: READY FOR LIVE TESTING

All components verified and operational:

- ‚úÖ Database schema complete
- ‚úÖ All services deployed and healthy
- ‚úÖ Secret Manager configured
- ‚úÖ Cloud Tasks queues created
- ‚úÖ Cloud Scheduler enabled
- ‚úÖ Test channel configured ($2.00 threshold, SHIB on ETH)
- ‚úÖ Routing logic functional (GCWebhook1 ‚Üí GCAccumulator)
- ‚úÖ Batch processor operational

**You can now proceed with your live $1.35 payment tests.**

---

## üìù Next Steps After Testing

1. Monitor first payment accumulation
2. Monitor second payment triggering batch
3. Verify SHIB payout received
4. Document any issues or improvements
5. Consider enabling more channels for threshold payout
