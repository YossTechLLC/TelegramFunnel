# Session Summary: Channel ID Mapping Fix - October 29, 2025

## Problem Report

User reported GCWebhook1-10-26 logs showing:
```
üîç [DATABASE] Fetching payout strategy for channel -1003272448971
‚ö†Ô∏è [DATABASE] No client found for channel -1003272448971, defaulting to instant
üí∞ [ENDPOINT] Payout strategy: instant
‚ö° [ENDPOINT] Instant payout mode - processing immediately
```

User manually verified that channel ID `-1003272448971` EXISTS in `main_clients_database`, but as `closed_channel_id` (private channel), NOT as `open_channel_id` (public channel).

## Root Cause Analysis

The entire system uses a consistent mapping:
- **`closed_channel_id`**: Private (paid) channel ID - what users subscribe to
- **`open_channel_id`**: Public (free) channel ID - used for advertising
- **`client_id` in payout_accumulation**: Stores `closed_channel_id` for payment tracking

### Database Schema (from SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)
```sql
CREATE TABLE main_clients_database (
    open_channel_id VARCHAR(14) PRIMARY KEY,     -- Public channel
    closed_channel_id VARCHAR(14) NOT NULL,      -- Private channel
    payout_strategy VARCHAR(20),                 -- 'instant' or 'threshold'
    payout_threshold_usd NUMERIC(10, 2),
    ...
);

CREATE TABLE payout_accumulation (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id VARCHAR(14) NOT NULL,              -- Actually closed_channel_id
    ...
);
```

### Token Flow Verification
1. User pays for subscription ‚Üí NOWPayments callback
2. GCWebhook1 receives token with `closed_channel_id` (e.g., -1003272448971)
3. GCWebhook1 passes `client_id = closed_channel_id` to GCAccumulator (line 200 in tph1-10-26.py)
4. GCAccumulator stores `client_id` in payout_accumulation table
5. GCBatchProcessor joins by `pa.client_id = mc.???` ‚Üê This needed fixing

## Bugs Found and Fixed

### Bug 1: GCWebhook1 database_manager.py (CRITICAL)
**File**: `GCWebhook1-10-26/database_manager.py:206`

**Before**:
```python
query = """
    SELECT payout_strategy, payout_threshold_usd
    FROM main_clients_database
    WHERE open_channel_id = %s  # ‚ùå WRONG - querying by public channel
"""
cur.execute(query, (str(closed_channel_id),))  # But passing private channel
```

**After**:
```python
query = """
    SELECT payout_strategy, payout_threshold_usd
    FROM main_clients_database
    WHERE closed_channel_id = %s  # ‚úÖ CORRECT - query by private channel
"""
cur.execute(query, (str(closed_channel_id),))
```

**Impact**: This caused ALL threshold payout channels to fallback to instant mode because the query never found matching clients.

### Bug 2: GCBatchProcessor database_manager.py (CRITICAL)
**File**: `GCBatchProcessor-10-26/database_manager.py:85`

**Before**:
```sql
FROM payout_accumulation pa
JOIN main_clients_database mc ON pa.client_id = mc.open_channel_id  -- ‚ùå WRONG JOIN
WHERE pa.is_paid_out = FALSE
```

**After**:
```sql
FROM payout_accumulation pa
JOIN main_clients_database mc ON pa.client_id = mc.closed_channel_id  -- ‚úÖ CORRECT JOIN
WHERE pa.is_paid_out = FALSE
```

**Impact**: Batch processor would NEVER find clients over threshold because the JOIN condition was incorrect.

### Bug 3: GCAccumulator documentation (Minor)
**File**: `GCAccumulator-10-26/database_manager.py:79`

**Before**:
```python
Args:
    client_id: open_channel_id from main_clients_database  # ‚ùå WRONG COMMENT
```

**After**:
```python
Args:
    client_id: closed_channel_id from main_clients_database (private channel ID)  # ‚úÖ CORRECT
```

**Impact**: Documentation-only fix, no functional impact.

## Architecture Clarity

### The Correct Channel ID Mapping

| Context | Uses Which ID | Why |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| User subscription payment | `closed_channel_id` | User pays to join PRIVATE channel |
| Token from NOWPayments | `closed_channel_id` | Payment is for private channel access |
| GCWebhook1 ‚Üí GCAccumulator | `client_id = closed_channel_id` | Track payments per private channel |
| payout_accumulation.client_id | `closed_channel_id` | Which private channel generated the payment |
| GCBatchProcessor JOIN | `mc.closed_channel_id` | Match payments to client configs |
| main_clients_database lookup | `WHERE closed_channel_id = ...` | Find client by their private channel |

**Key Insight**: The PRIMARY KEY of main_clients_database is `open_channel_id`, but most operations query by `closed_channel_id` because that's what payments are associated with.

## Services Deployed

### 1. GCWebhook1-10-26 ‚úÖ
- **Fix**: Changed database query from `open_channel_id` to `closed_channel_id`
- **Deployed**: October 29, 2025, ~11:15 AM EDT
- **Impact**: Threshold payout routing will now work correctly

### 2. GCBatchProcessor-10-26 ‚úÖ
- **Fix**: Changed JOIN condition from `open_channel_id` to `closed_channel_id`
- **Deployed**: October 29, 2025, 11:11 AM EDT
- **Impact**: Batch processor can now find clients over threshold

### 3. GCAccumulator-10-26 ‚úÖ
- **Fix**: Updated documentation comment for `client_id` parameter
- **Deployed**: October 29, 2025, ~11:15 AM EDT
- **Impact**: Code documentation now accurate

## Testing Plan

### Test Scenario 1: Threshold Payout Mode
1. User pays for subscription to private channel `-1003272448971`
2. GCWebhook1 receives payment callback
3. **Expected**: Query finds client with `closed_channel_id = '-1003272448971'`
4. **Expected**: Returns `payout_strategy = 'threshold'` and threshold value
5. **Expected**: Routes to GCAccumulator instead of GCSplit1
6. **Expected**: Log shows "Found client by closed_channel_id: strategy=threshold, threshold=$XXX"

### Test Scenario 2: Batch Payout Trigger
1. Multiple payments accumulate for a client
2. GCBatchProcessor checks for clients over threshold
3. **Expected**: JOIN successfully matches `pa.client_id = mc.closed_channel_id`
4. **Expected**: Finds clients with accumulated USDT >= threshold
5. **Expected**: Creates batch payout records
6. **Expected**: Routes to GCSplit1 for batch execution

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check GCWebhook1 logs
gcloud logging read "resource.labels.service_name=gcwebhook1-10-26 AND timestamp>='2025-10-29T15:00:00Z' AND textPayload:'Found client'" --limit=20

# Check GCAccumulator logs
gcloud logging read "resource.labels.service_name=gcaccumulator-10-26 AND timestamp>='2025-10-29T15:00:00Z'" --limit=20

# Check GCBatchProcessor logs
gcloud logging read "resource.labels.service_name=gcbatchprocessor-10-26 AND timestamp>='2025-10-29T15:00:00Z'" --limit=20
```

## Previous Issues Resolved in Same Session

### GCAccumulator & GCBatchProcessor Configuration Errors
1. **Cursor Context Manager Error**: Fixed `'Cursor' object does not support the context manager protocol`
   - Cause: pg8000 doesn't support cursor context managers
   - Fix: Changed to manual cursor lifecycle management

2. **Missing Environment Variables**: All secrets showing as ‚ùå
   - Cause: ConfigManager trying to use Secret Manager API with environment variable paths
   - Fix: Modified ConfigManager.fetch_secret() to read from os.getenv() directly

3. **Deployment**: Both services rebuilt and redeployed with fixes

## Summary

Successfully identified and fixed THREE critical bugs in the channel ID mapping system:

1. **GCWebhook1**: Fixed database query to use `closed_channel_id` instead of `open_channel_id`
2. **GCBatchProcessor**: Fixed JOIN condition to use `closed_channel_id` instead of `open_channel_id`
3. **GCAccumulator**: Fixed documentation to clarify `client_id` represents `closed_channel_id`

All three services have been rebuilt and redeployed. The threshold payout system should now work correctly, with payments properly routed to GCAccumulator when configured, and batch processor able to find clients over their thresholds.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor next payment to verify correct routing
2. Verify logs show "Found client by closed_channel_id" message
3. Test batch processor with multiple accumulated payments
4. Confirm end-to-end threshold payout flow works
