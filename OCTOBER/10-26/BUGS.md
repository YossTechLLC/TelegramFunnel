### 🐛 GCWebhook2 Event Loop Closure Error
- **Date Fixed:** October 26, 2025
- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** GCWebhook2 was encountering "Event loop is closed" errors when running as async Flask route in Cloud Run
- **Root Cause:**
  - Async Flask route reused event loop between requests
  - Bot instance created at module level shared httpx connection pool
  - Cloud Run's stateless model closed event loops between requests
- **Solution:**
  - Changed to sync Flask route with `asyncio.run()`
  - Create fresh Bot instance per-request
  - Isolated event loop lifecycle within each request
  - Event loop and connections properly cleaned up after each request
- **Files Modified:**
  - `GCWebhook2-10-26/tph2-10-26.py`
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed and tested in production

### 🐛 Database Connection Pool Exhaustion
- **Date Fixed:** October 25, 2025
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Database connection pool running out under high load
- **Root Cause:** Connections not being properly closed in some error paths
- **Solution:**
  - Wrapped all database operations in context managers
  - Ensured connections closed even on exceptions
  - Added connection pool monitoring
- **Files Modified:**
  - `TelePay10-26/database.py`
  - `GCWebhook1-10-26/database_manager.py`
  - `GCSplit1-10-26/database_manager.py`
  - `GCHostPay1-10-26/database_manager.py`
  - `GCHostPay3-10-26/database_manager.py`
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 🐛 Database Field Name Mismatch (db_password vs database_password)
- **Date Fixed:** October 26, 2025
- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** Inconsistent naming between config_manager (db_password) and some services expecting database_password
- **Root Cause:** Refactoring left some references outdated
- **Solution:** Standardized to `database_password` in config_manager.py across all services
- **Files Modified:**
  - Multiple `config_manager.py` files
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

## Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### ⚠️ Rate Limiting Disabled in GCRegister

### ⚠️ Webhook Signature Verification Incomplete

- **Files Affected:**
  - `GCWebhook1-10-26/tph1-10-26.py`
