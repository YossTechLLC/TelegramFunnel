## Recent Decisions

### 2025-11-02: TelePay Bot - Secret Manager Integration for IPN Callback URL

**Decision:** Modified TelePay bot to fetch IPN callback URL from Google Cloud Secret Manager instead of directly from environment variables

**Context:**
- Phase 3 of payment_id implementation originally used direct environment variable lookup
- Inconsistent with existing secret management pattern for `PAYMENT_PROVIDER_TOKEN`
- Environment variables storing sensitive URLs less secure than Secret Manager
- Needed centralized secret management across all services

**Implementation:**
1. **New Method Added:**
   - `fetch_ipn_callback_url()` method follows same pattern as `fetch_payment_provider_token()`
   - Fetches from Secret Manager using path from `NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_CALLBACK_URL` env var
   - Returns IPN URL or None if not configured

2. **Initialization Pattern:**
   - `__init__()` now calls `fetch_ipn_callback_url()` on startup
   - Stores IPN URL in `self.ipn_callback_url` instance variable
   - Can be overridden via constructor parameter for testing

3. **Invoice Creation:**
   - `create_payment_invoice()` uses `self.ipn_callback_url` instead of `os.getenv()`
   - Single fetch on initialization, not on every invoice creation
   - Better performance and consistent behavior

**Rationale:**
- **Security:** Secrets stored in Secret Manager with IAM controls, audit logging, versioning
- **Consistency:** Matches existing pattern for all other secrets in codebase
- **Maintainability:** Single source of truth for IPN URL configuration
- **Flexibility:** Environment variable only needs secret path, not the actual URL
- **Observability:** Better logging at fetch time vs. usage time

**Trade-offs:**
- Environment variable now stores secret path instead of actual URL
- Secret Manager API call on bot startup (minimal latency ~50-100ms)
- Must restart bot to pick up secret changes (acceptable for infrequent changes)

**Impact:**
- ✅ More secure secret management
- ✅ Consistent with codebase patterns
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ✅ Zero impact on invoice creation performance

**Configuration Required:**
```bash
# Old way (Phase 3 - Direct URL):
export NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_CALLBACK_URL="https://np-webhook-291176869049.us-east1.run.app"

# New way (Session 26 - Secret Manager path):
export NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_CALLBACK_URL="projects/telepay-459221/secrets/NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_CALLBACK_URL/versions/latest"
```

### 2025-11-02: NowPayments Payment ID Storage Architecture

**Decision:** Implemented payment_id storage and propagation through the payment flow to enable fee discrepancy resolution

**Context:**
- Fee discrepancies discovered between NowPayments charges and actual blockchain transactions
- Cannot reconcile fees without linking NowPayments payment_id to our database records
- Need to track actual fees paid vs. estimated fees for accurate accounting

**Implementation:**
1. **Database Layer:**
   - Added 10 NowPayments columns to `private_channel_users_database` (payment_id, invoice_id, order_id, pay_address, payment_status, pay_amount, pay_currency, outcome_amount, created_at, updated_at)
   - Added 5 NowPayments columns to `payout_accumulation` (payment_id, pay_address, outcome_amount, network_fee, payment_fee_usd)
   - Created indexes on payment_id and order_id for fast lookups

2. **Service Integration:**
   - Leveraged existing `np-webhook` service for IPN handling
   - Updated GCWebhook1 to query payment_id after database write and pass to GCAccumulator
   - Updated GCAccumulator to store payment_id in payout_accumulation records
   - Added NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_SECRET and NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_CALLBACK_URL to Secret Manager

3. **TelePay Bot Updates (Phase 3):**
   - Updated `start_np_gateway.py` to include `ipn_callback_url` in NowPayments invoice creation
   - Bot now passes IPN endpoint to NowPayments: `https://np-webhook-291176869049.us-east1.run.app`
   - Added logging to track invoice_id, order_id, and IPN callback URL for debugging
   - Environment variable `NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_CALLBACK_URL` must be set before bot starts

4. **Data Flow:**
   - TelePay bot creates invoice with `ipn_callback_url` specified
   - Customer pays → NowPayments sends IPN to np-webhook
   - NowPayments IPN → np-webhook → updates `private_channel_users_database` with payment_id
   - NowPayments success_url → GCWebhook1 → queries payment_id → passes to GCAccumulator
   - GCAccumulator → stores payment_id in `payout_accumulation`

**Rationale:**
- Minimal changes to existing architecture (reused np-webhook service)
- payment_id propagates through entire payment flow automatically
- Enables future fee reconciliation tools via NowPayments API queries
- Database indexes ensure fast lookups even with large datasets

**Trade-offs:**
- Relies on np-webhook IPN arriving before success_url (usually true, but not guaranteed)
- If IPN delayed, payment_id will be NULL initially but can be backfilled
- Additional database storage for NowPayments metadata (~300 bytes per payment)

**Impact:**
- Zero downtime migration (additive schema changes)
- Backward compatible (payment_id fields are optional)
- Foundation for accurate fee tracking and discrepancy resolution

### 2025-11-02: Micro-Batch Processor Schedule Optimization

**Decision:** Reduced micro-batch-conversion-job scheduler interval from 15 minutes to 5 minutes

**Rationale:**
- Faster threshold detection for accumulated payments
- Improved payout latency for users (3x faster threshold checks)
- Aligns with batch-processor-job interval (also 5 minutes)
- No functional changes to service logic - only scheduling frequency

**Impact:**
- Threshold checks now occur every 5 minutes instead of 15 minutes
- Maximum wait time for threshold detection reduced from 15 min to 5 min
- Expected payout completion time reduced by up to 10 minutes
- Minimal increase in Cloud Scheduler API calls (cost negligible)

**Configuration:**
```
Schedule: */5 * * * * (Etc/UTC)
Target: https://gcmicrobatchprocessor-10-26-291176869049.us-central1.run.app/check-threshold
State: ENABLED
```
