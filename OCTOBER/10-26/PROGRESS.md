## Recent Updates

## 2025-11-02 Session 26: TelePay Bot - Secret Manager Integration for IPN URL ✅

**Objective:** Update TelePay bot to fetch IPN callback URL from Secret Manager instead of environment variable

**Actions Completed:**
- ✅ Added `fetch_ipn_callback_url()` method to `PaymentGatewayManager` class
- ✅ Updated `__init__()` to fetch IPN URL from Secret Manager on initialization
- ✅ Uses `NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_CALLBACK_URL` environment variable to store secret path
- ✅ Updated `create_payment_invoice()` to use `self.ipn_callback_url` instead of direct env lookup
- ✅ Enhanced logging with success/error messages for Secret Manager fetch
- ✅ Updated PROGRESS.md with Session 26 entry

**Code Changes:**
```python
# New method in PaymentGatewayManager
def fetch_ipn_callback_url(self) -> Optional[str]:
    """Fetch the IPN callback URL from Secret Manager."""
    try:
        client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient()
        secret_path = os.getenv("NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_CALLBACK_URL")
        if not secret_path:
            print(f"⚠️ [IPN] Environment variable NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_CALLBACK_URL is not set")
            return None
        response = client.access_secret_version(request={"name": secret_path})
        ipn_url = response.payload.data.decode("UTF-8")
        print(f"✅ [IPN] Successfully fetched IPN callback URL from Secret Manager")
        return ipn_url
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ [IPN] Error fetching IPN callback URL: {e}")
        return None

# Updated __init__
self.ipn_callback_url = ipn_callback_url or self.fetch_ipn_callback_url()

# Updated invoice creation
"ipn_callback_url": self.ipn_callback_url,  # Fetched from Secret Manager
```

**Impact:**
- 🔐 More secure: IPN URL now stored in Secret Manager, not environment variables
- 🎯 Consistent pattern: Matches existing secret fetching for PAYMENT_PROVIDER_TOKEN
- ✅ Backward compatible: Can still override via constructor parameter if needed
- 📋 Better logging: Clear success/error messages for troubleshooting

**Deployment Requirements:**
- ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED:** Set environment variable before running bot:
  ```bash
  export NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_CALLBACK_URL="projects/telepay-459221/secrets/NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_CALLBACK_URL/versions/latest"
  ```
- ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED:** Restart TelePay bot to apply changes

**Verification:**
Bot logs should show on startup:
```
✅ [IPN] Successfully fetched IPN callback URL from Secret Manager
```

When creating invoice:
```
📋 [INVOICE] Created invoice_id: <ID>
📋 [INVOICE] Order ID: <ORDER_ID>
📋 [INVOICE] IPN will be sent to: https://np-webhook-291176869049.us-east1.run.app
```

## 2025-11-02 Session 25: NowPayments Payment ID Storage - Phase 3 TelePay Bot Integration ✅

**Objective:** Update TelePay bot to include `ipn_callback_url` in NowPayments invoice creation for payment_id capture

**Actions Completed:**
- ✅ Updated `/OCTOBER/10-26/TelePay10-26/start_np_gateway.py`
- ✅ Modified `create_payment_invoice()` method to include `ipn_callback_url` field
- ✅ Added environment variable lookup: `os.getenv('NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_CALLBACK_URL')`
- ✅ Added logging for invoice_id, order_id, and IPN callback URL
- ✅ Added warning when IPN URL not configured
- ✅ Verified `NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_CALLBACK_URL` secret exists in Secret Manager
- ✅ Verified secret points to np-webhook service: `https://np-webhook-291176869049.us-east1.run.app`
- ✅ Updated NOWPAYMENTS_PAYMENT_ID_STORAGE_ANALYSIS_ARCHITECTURE_CHECKLIST_PROGRESS.md
- ✅ Updated NOWPAYMENTS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md with Phase 3 details

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Invoice payload now includes IPN callback URL
invoice_payload = {
    "price_amount": amount,
    "price_currency": "USD",
    "order_id": order_id,
    "order_description": "Payment-Test-1",
    "success_url": success_url,
    "ipn_callback_url": ipn_callback_url,  # NEW - for payment_id capture
    "is_fixed_rate": False,
    "is_fee_paid_by_user": False
}

# Added logging
print(f"📋 [INVOICE] Created invoice_id: {invoice_id}")
print(f"📋 [INVOICE] Order ID: {order_id}")
print(f"📋 [INVOICE] IPN will be sent to: {ipn_callback_url}")
```

**Impact:**

  ```bash
  export NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_CALLBACK_URL="https://np-webhook-291176869049.us-east1.run.app"
  ```
- ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED:** Restart TelePay bot to apply changes

**Implementation Status:**
- Phase 1 (Database Migration): ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 2 (Service Integration): ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 3 (TelePay Bot Updates): ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 4 (Testing & Validation): ⏳ PENDING

**Next Steps:**
- ⏭️ User to set environment variable and restart bot
- ⏭️ Perform end-to-end test payment
- ⏭️ Verify payment_id captured in database
- ⏭️ Verify payment_id propagated through entire pipeline
- ⏭️ Monitor payment_id capture rate (target: >95%)

## 2025-11-01 Session 22: Threshold Payout System - Health Check & Validation ✅

**Objective:** Perform comprehensive sanity check and health validation of threshold payout workflow before user executes 2x$1.35 test payments

**Actions Completed:**
- ✅ Reviewed all 11 critical services in threshold payout workflow
- ✅ Analyzed recent logs from GCWebhook1, GCWebhook2, GCSplit services (1-3)
- ✅ Analyzed recent logs from GCAccumulator and GCMicroBatchProcessor
- ✅ Analyzed recent logs from GCBatchProcessor and GCHostPay services (1-3)
- ✅ Verified threshold configuration: $2.00 (from Secret Manager)
- ✅ Verified scheduler jobs: micro-batch (15 min) and batch processor (5 min)
- ✅ Verified Cloud Tasks queues: All 16 critical queues operational
- ✅ Validated user assumptions about workflow behavior
- ✅ Created comprehensive health check report

**Key Findings:**
- 🎯 All 11 critical services operational and healthy
- ✅ Threshold correctly set at $2.00 (MICRO_BATCH_THRESHOLD_USD)
- ✅ Recent payment successfully processed ($1.35 → $1.1475 after 15% fee)
