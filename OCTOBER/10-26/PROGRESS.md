## Recent Updates

## 2025-11-02 Session 23: Micro-Batch Processor Schedule Optimization ✅

**Objective:** Reduce micro-batch processor cron job interval from 15 minutes to 5 minutes for faster threshold detection

**Actions Completed:**
- ✅ Retrieved current micro-batch-conversion-job configuration
- ✅ Updated schedule from `*/15 * * * *` to `*/5 * * * *`
- ✅ Verified both scheduler jobs now run every 5 minutes:
  - micro-batch-conversion-job: */5 * * * * (Etc/UTC)
  - batch-processor-job: */5 * * * * (America/Los_Angeles)
- ✅ Updated DECISIONS.md with optimization rationale
- ✅ Updated PROGRESS.md with session documentation

**Impact:**
- ⚡ Threshold checks now occur 3x faster (every 5 min instead of 15 min)
- ⏱️ Maximum wait time for threshold detection reduced from 15 min to 5 min
- 🎯 Expected total payout completion time reduced by up to 10 minutes
- 🔄 Both scheduler jobs now aligned at 5-minute intervals

**Configuration:**
- Service: GCMicroBatchProcessor-10-26
- Endpoint: /check-threshold
- Schedule: */5 * * * * (Etc/UTC)
- State: ENABLED

## 2025-11-01 Session 22: Threshold Payout System - Health Check & Validation ✅

**Objective:** Perform comprehensive sanity check and health validation of threshold payout workflow before user executes 2x$1.35 test payments

**Actions Completed:**
- ✅ Reviewed all 11 critical services in threshold payout workflow
- ✅ Analyzed recent logs from GCWebhook1, GCWebhook2, GCSplit services (1-3)
- ✅ Analyzed recent logs from GCAccumulator and GCMicroBatchProcessor
- ✅ Analyzed recent logs from GCBatchProcessor and GCHostPay services (1-3)
- ✅ Verified threshold configuration: $2.00 (from Secret Manager)
- ✅ Verified scheduler jobs: micro-batch (15 min) and batch processor (5 min)
- ✅ Verified Cloud Tasks queues: All 16 critical queues operational
- ✅ Validated user assumptions about workflow behavior
- ✅ Created comprehensive health check report

**Key Findings:**
- 🎯 All 11 critical services operational and healthy
- ✅ Threshold correctly set at $2.00 (MICRO_BATCH_THRESHOLD_USD)
- ✅ Recent payment successfully processed ($1.35 → $1.1475 after 15% fee)
- ✅ GCAccumulator working correctly (Accumulation ID: 8 stored)
- ✅ GCMicroBatchProcessor checking threshold every 15 minutes
- ✅ GCBatchProcessor checking for payouts every 5 minutes
- ✅ All Cloud Tasks queues running with appropriate rate limits
- ✅ Scheduler jobs active and enabled

**Workflow Validation:**
- User's assumption: **CORRECT** ✅
  - First payment ($1.35) → Accumulates $1.1475 (below threshold)
  - Second payment ($1.35) → Total $2.295 (exceeds $2.00 threshold)
  - Expected behavior: Triggers ETH → USDT conversion
  - Then: USDT → Client Currency (SHIB) payout

**System Health Score:** 100% - All systems ready

**Output:**
- 📄 Created `THRESHOLD_PAYOUT_HEALTH_CHECK_REPORT.md`
  - Executive summary with workflow diagram
  - Service-by-service health status
  - Configuration validation
  - Recent transaction evidence
  - Timeline prediction for expected behavior
  - Pre-transaction checklist (all items passed)
  - Monitoring commands for tracking progress
