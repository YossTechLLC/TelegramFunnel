# Deploy and Test Guide - Enhanced Logging for ChangeNow API Debugging

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Purpose:** Deploy enhanced logging versions of tps10-9 to identify why ChangeNow API requests are not visible

---

## Summary of Changes

I've added comprehensive enhanced logging to the following files:

### 1. `GCSplit7-14/changenow_client.py`
- **Added:** Detailed logging in `_make_request()` method
- **Logs:** Full HTTP request details (URL, headers, body)
- **Logs:** Full HTTP response details (status, headers, body)
- **Logs:** Complete stack traces for all exceptions
- **Logs:** Entry/exit markers for all API calls

### 2. `GCSplit7-14/tps10-9.py`
- **Added:** Step-by-step logging in `process_payment_split()`
- **Added:** Detailed logging in `create_fixed_rate_transaction()`
- **Logs:** Each validation step with success/failure status
- **Logs:** Function entry/exit markers
- **Logs:** Complete stack traces for exceptions

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy tps10-9 with Enhanced Logging

```bash
# Navigate to GCSplit7-14 directory
cd /mnt/c/Users/YossTech/Desktop/2025/TelegramFunnel/OCTOBER/10-9/GCSplit7-14

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy tps10-9 \
    --source . \
    --region us-central1 \
    --port 8080 \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --service-account=291176869049-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
    --set-env-vars CHANGENOW_API_KEY=projects/291176869049/secrets/CHANGENOW_API_KEY/versions/latest \
    --set-env-vars WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY=projects/291176869049/secrets/WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY/versions/latest \
    --set-env-vars TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME=projects/291176869049/secrets/TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME/versions/latest \
    --set-env-vars HPW_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hpw10-9-291176869049.us-central1.run.app/gcsplit
```

**Expected output:**
```
Deploying from source. To deploy a container use [--image]. See https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying-source-code for more details.

Done.
Service [tps10-9] revision [tps10-9-00001-xxx] has been deployed and is serving 100 percent of traffic.
Service URL: https://tps10-9-291176869049.us-central1.run.app
```

---

### Step 2: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check service status
gcloud run services describe tps10-9 --region us-central1 --format="value(status.url,status.conditions)"

# Test health endpoint
curl https://tps10-9-291176869049.us-central1.run.app/health
```

**Expected health response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "TPS10-9 Payment Splitting",
  "timestamp": 1234567890
}
```

---

### Step 3: Verify tph10-13 Has TPS_WEBHOOK_URL Configured

```bash
# Check tph10-13 environment variables
gcloud run services describe tph10-13 --region us-central1 --format="value(spec.template.spec.containers[0].env)"
```

**Look for:**
```
TPS_WEBHOOK_URL=https://tps10-9-291176869049.us-central1.run.app
```

**If missing, add it:**
```bash
gcloud run services update tph10-13 \
    --region us-central1 \
    --set-env-vars TPS_WEBHOOK_URL=https://tps10-9-291176869049.us-central1.run.app
```

## Testing Procedure

### Step 1: Trigger a Test Payment

1. Generate a payment URL with your token generator
2. Open the URL in a browser
3. User should receive Telegram invite link
4. Payment should complete successfully

---

### Step 2: Monitor tph10-13 Logs

**Open Cloud Console:**
```
Cloud Run → tph10-13 → Logs

## Interpreting Results

### Scenario 1: TPS_WEBHOOK_URL Not Configured

**Symptoms:**
- tph10-13 logs show: `"⚠️ [PAYMENT_SPLITTING] TPS_WEBHOOK_URL not configured"`
- tps10-9 logs show: No webhook received

**Root Cause:** TPS_WEBHOOK_URL environment variable missing in tph10-13

**Fix:**
```bash
gcloud run services update tph10-13 \
    --region us-central1 \
    --set-env-vars TPS_WEBHOOK_URL=https://tps10-9-291176869049.us-central1.run.app
```

---

### Scenario 2: tps10-9 Not Deployed

**Symptoms:**
- tph10-13 logs show: `"❌ [PAYMENT_SPLITTING] Webhook connection error"`
- tps10-9 logs show: Nothing (service doesn't exist)

**Root Cause:** tps10-9 service was never deployed

**Fix:** Run deployment command from Step 1 above

---

### Scenario 3: Webhook Signature Verification Failure

**Symptoms:**
- tph10-13 logs show: `"❌ [PAYMENT_SPLITTING] Webhook failed with status 401"`
- tps10-9 logs show: `"❌ [WEBHOOK] Invalid signature"`

**Root Cause:** SUCCESS_URL_SIGNING_KEY (tph10-13) ≠ WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY (tps10-9)

**Fix:** Ensure both services use the same signing key secret

---

### Scenario 4: CHANGENOW_API_KEY Not Configured

**Symptoms:**
- tps10-9 logs show: No `"🔗 [CHANGENOW_CLIENT] Initialized with API key"`
- tps10-9 logs show: Config manager errors

**Root Cause:** CHANGENOW_API_KEY environment variable missing or secret not accessible

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify secret exists
gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret="CHANGENOW_API_KEY"

# If missing, create it
echo -n "0e7ab0b9cfd8dd81479e811eb583b01a2b5c7f3aac00d5075225a4241e0a5bde" | \
    gcloud secrets create CHANGENOW_API_KEY --data-file=-

# Ensure tps10-9 has access
gcloud run services update tps10-9 \
    --region us-central1 \
    --set-env-vars CHANGENOW_API_KEY=projects/291176869049/secrets/CHANGENOW_API_KEY/versions/latest
```

---

### Scenario 5: Currency Pair Not Supported

**Symptoms:**
- tps10-9 logs show: `"❌ [PAYMENT_SPLITTING] VALIDATION FAILED! Currency pair not supported"`
- No API call made

**Root Cause:** User requested payout currency not available on ChangeNow

**Fix:** Check available pairs with `get_available_pairs()` or use different currency

---

### Scenario 6: Amount Outside Limits

**Symptoms:**
- tps10-9 logs show: `"❌ [PAYMENT_SPLITTING] VALIDATION FAILED! Amount outside limits"`
- No API call made

**Root Cause:** Payment amount below ChangeNow minimum or above maximum

**Fix:** Adjust subscription price or check ChangeNow limits for the currency pair

---

### Scenario 7: API Request Timeout

**Symptoms:**
- tps10-9 logs show: `"❌ [CHANGENOW_API] Request timeout after 30s"`
- No response received

**Root Cause:** ChangeNow server not responding or network issue

**Fix:** Retry payment, check ChangeNow status page

---

### Scenario 8: API Key Invalid/Unauthorized

**Symptoms:**
- tps10-9 logs show: `"Response status: 401"`
- API request sent but rejected

**Root Cause:** API key incorrect or expired

**Fix:** Update CHANGENOW_API_KEY secret with valid key

---

### Scenario 9: Malformed Request Payload

**Symptoms:**
- tps10-9 logs show: `"Response status: 400"`
- Response body shows validation errors

**Root Cause:** Payload structure incorrect

**Fix:** Compare logged payload with working curl command, fix differences

---

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you've completed the test payment and reviewed the logs:

1. **Identify which scenario matches your logs**
2. **Apply the corresponding fix**
3. **Redeploy if needed**
4. **Test again to verify fix**
5. **Report findings**
