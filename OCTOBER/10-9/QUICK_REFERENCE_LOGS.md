## If ChangeNow API IS Working

You'll see this sequence in tps10-9 logs:
1. `>>> ENTERING _make_request <<<`
2. `POST https://api.changenow.io/v2/exchange`
3. `Sending HTTP request...`
4. `Response received!`
5. `Response status: 200`
6. `✅ [CHANGENOW_TRANSACTION] Transaction ID:`

---

## If ChangeNow API Is NOT Working

The sequence will stop before step 6 above. Check where it stops:

**Stops at step 1?** → Function never called (validation failed earlier)
**Stops at step 2?** → Exception in _make_request
**Stops at step 3?** → Payload construction failed
**Stops at step 4?** → HTTP request never sent (connection error)
**Stops at step 5?** → No response (timeout)
**Status ≠ 200?** → API rejected request (check error message)
